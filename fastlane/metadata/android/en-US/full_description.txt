Compare an unlimited number of products to find the best price. Save money smartly.

We often come across products that are sold at different prices depending on the quantity, and it's difficult to know which one is cheaper.

With the "Compare Prices" app, you can give each product a name (optional), enter the price, quantity, and number of units for each item. The app will automatically calculate the price based on the total product quantity and the currency obtained by the chosen currency. Items are then sorted based on the best value so you can easily find the best price.

Features include:
* 4 types of units (Weight, Volume, Length, and Pieces).
* Easy currency symbol change.
* Price summary for each product (price/unit of measure and quantity/price).
* You can see all items at the best price sorted to a single unit of measure.
* Change the number of decimal places for rounding.
